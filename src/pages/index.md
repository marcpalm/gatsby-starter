  title: Why we invest?
  description: |2
        We believe in freedom. Financial freedom is one of the main pillar. Only
        passive income will achieve this. Stock investments are the easiest way to
        start it. You can begin with little sum and it scales indefinitely.
description: '    We distinguish between investing and speculating. Investing means buying     assets such as stock, real estate and bonds for the earnings they generate.     Speculating equals buying something to sell it to a greater fool tomorrow.  We specialise largely on stock investments and analyse them according to  their financial statement.'
